# Practicing-Julia-and-System-Identification
Jupyter notebooks of Julia code about System Identification Algorithms

These are actually exercises from a Postgraduate course taken at PPGEE/UFPR (_Programa de Pós-Graduação em Engenharia Elétrica / Universidade Federal do Paraná_).

The course was taken from March 12nd until August 20th.

I'm using this repository to help me not to lose my exercises, and also to make them as self-explainable as possible.

All the texts, explanations, and even codes are in Portuguese. As they're being graded, it seems better to write them in my native language.

- Exercise 1 - OK (_needs revision_)
- Exercise 2 - OK (_needs revision_)
- Exercise 3 - OK (_needs revision_)
- Exercise 4 - OK (_needs revision_)
- Exercise 5 - OK (_needs revision_)
- Exercise 6 - OK (_needs revision_)
- Exercise 7 - Still working on 
- Exercise N .... (to be continued)

Maybe I'll add some additional comments later. But for now, take care!
