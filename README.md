# Practicing-Julia-and-System-Identification
Jupyter notebooks of Julia code about System Identification Algorithms

These are actually exercises from a Postgraduate course taken at PPGEE/UFPR (_Programa de Pós-Graduação em Engenharia Elétrica / Universidade Federal do Paraná_).

The course was taken from March 12nd until August 20th.

I'm using this repository to help me not to lose my exercises, and also to make them as self-explainable as possible.

Maybe I'll add some additional comments later. But for now, take care!
